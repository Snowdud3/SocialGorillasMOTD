Hello again Social Monkes! We have quite the change this update! The most important being: we have a title screen! In the Title screen as you may have noticed: you can either go to a tutorial level or go straight to the main map! Cool eh? We do have an issue with the horror area where the map loader bugs out so for now the map loader has been removed until it can be fixed again. I am still trying to figure out how to fix the lag issues so stay with me on that issue! Anyway that is all I have to say but if you want to know EVERYTHING that is new then go to our website through our Discord! Or you can just explore to search for them! See you little monke!
